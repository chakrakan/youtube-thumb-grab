# Thumb-Grab

Get thumbnails of YouTube videos in any given playlist, resize them to your custom res of choice.

Orginially built while I was a part of TEDxUTSC and volunteered as a webmaster. This script allowed me to automate the whole process of grabbing thumnails of 160+ TED videos from large youtube playlists, and re-sizing them so they could be displayed on the TEDxUTSC website.
